MAVEN (JAVA)

Solution from first task (calculator) was translated from C# to Java. Dependencies added are: junit, junit.jupiter and com.afrunt.imdb (database of films from imdb portal). 

Added 7 new tests for new functionality of calculator. Additionaly if we obtain proper result or do proper calculation then we will get title of film (connected with result - form of easter egg) thanks to imdb dependency (3 tests).
